## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

1. **D365 Finance & Operations Environment** (Sandbox or Production)
2. **Azure AD Application Registration** with appropriate permissions
3. **Python 3.10+** installed on your system
4. **Claude Desktop** (optional, for direct AI integration)

## Installation

### 1. Clone and Set Up the Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/d365fo-mcp
cd d365fo-mcp

# Create and activate virtual environment (using uv - recommended)
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

### 2. Configure Azure AD Application

You need to create an Azure AD application to authenticate with D365FO:

1. **Go to Azure Portal** ‚Üí Azure Active Directory ‚Üí App registrations
2. **Click "New registration"**
3. **Set the name**: "D365FO MCP Server"
4. **Leave other defaults** and click "Register"
5. **Note the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID**
6. **Go to "Certificates & secrets"** ‚Üí Create a new client secret
7. **Copy the secret value** (you won't be able to see it again)

### 3. Configure D365FO Permissions

In your D365FO environment, you need to grant permissions:

1. **System Administration** ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Users
2. **Find your service principal** (same name as your Azure AD app)
3. **Assign appropriate security roles** (typically "System user" + business-specific roles)

### 4. Create Configuration File

Copy the example configuration and fill in your details:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file:

```bash
# D365 Authentication (Required)
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-from-azure
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-from-azure
AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id-from-azure

# D365 Instance Configuration (Required)  
D365_BASE_URL=https://your-env.sandbox.operations.dynamics.com

# Optional Configuration
DATAAREAID=usmf                    # Your default company/legal entity
DATABASE_PATH=./data/d365fo-mcp.db # Local cache location
METADATA_CACHE_HOURS=24            # How long to cache metadata
LOG_LEVEL=info                     # Logging verbosity
```

## First Run and Validation

### 1. Validate Your Configuration

Before running the server, validate your setup:

```bash
python -m d365fo_mcp.main --validate-config
```

This will:
- Test your Azure AD authentication
- Verify D365FO connectivity
- Check that all required permissions are in place
- Validate your configuration settings

### 2. Initialize the Database

Set up the local SQLite database for metadata caching:

```bash
python -m d365fo_mcp.main --init-db
```

### 3. Run Manual Metadata Sync (Optional)

For faster first-time setup, manually sync D365 metadata:

```bash
python scripts/manual_sync.py
```

This downloads and processes your D365FO metadata (~40-50MB) and stores it locally for fast searches. The process typically takes 15-30 seconds.

## Running the Server

### Standalone Mode

For testing and development:

```bash
python -m d365fo_mcp.main
```

The server runs in STDIO mode and waits for MCP protocol messages.

### Claude Desktop Integration

For seamless AI integration, add to your Claude Desktop configuration:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/mcp.json`  
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\mcp.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "D365FO MCP Server": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["-m", "d365fo_mcp.main"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/d365fo-mcp",
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/absolute/path/to/d365fo-mcp",
        "AZURE_CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id",
        "AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret",
        "AZURE_TENANT_ID": "your-tenant-id",
        "D365_BASE_URL": "https://your-env.sandbox.operations.dynamics.com",
        "DATAAREAID": "usmf",
        "DATABASE_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/d365fo-mcp/data/d365fo-mcp.db"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Use absolute paths for all file paths in Claude Desktop configuration.
