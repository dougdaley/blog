title: "The Target Operating Model Method for Technology Enablement"
subtitle: "A systematic approach to transforming business functions through strategic technology integration"
---

This method provides organizations with a comprehensive framework for designing and implementing target operating models that harness technology to drive sustainable business transformation.

## Introduction

Too many technology transformations fail not because of technical limitations, but because they lack a coherent method for integrating business strategy, organizational design, and technology implementation. This creates a gap between aspiration and execution that undermines even the most well-funded initiatives.

The Target Operating Model Method addresses this challenge by providing a systematic approach that begins with strategic intent and works methodically through the layers of organizational change required to achieve sustainable transformation. Built from experience across enterprise transformations, it offers practical guidance for navigating the complexities of modern digital change.

## Guiding Principles

### 01. Business-Led Transformation
Technology serves business strategy, not the other way around. Every technological decision must be grounded in clear business outcomes and strategic intent.

### 02. Human-Centered Design
People adopt change, not organizations. Design every aspect of the transformation with the end user experience as the primary consideration.

### 03. Iterative Implementation
Build, learn, adapt. Use iterative delivery approaches to reduce risk and incorporate learning throughout the transformation journey.

### 04. Sustainable Evolution
Design for ongoing adaptation, not just initial implementation. Create organizational capabilities that can evolve with changing business requirements.
